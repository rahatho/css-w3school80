<!--CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.-->

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
        h1, h2, p {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
        }
       
    </style>
    <title>CSS Grouping  selector </title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>The CSS Grouping selector</h1>
    <p>
        The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
    </p>
    <p>Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):</p>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h2>Smaller heading!</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
