<!--CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.-->

    <h1>CSS Combinators</h1>
    <p>
        A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
    </p>
    <p>There are four different combinators in CSS:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>descendant selector (space)</li>
        <li>child selector (>)</li>
        <li>adjacent sibling selector (+)</li>
        <li>general sibling selector (~)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</h2>

    <p>The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.</p>

    <p>Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".</p>

    <p>The following example selects the first p element that are placed immediately after div elements:</p>

    
        <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
        <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>

    <p>Paragraph 3 After a div.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 4 After a div.</p>

        <p>Paragraph 5 in the div.</p>
        <p>Paragraph 6 in the div.</p>

    <p>Paragraph 7 After a div.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 8 After a div.</p>
