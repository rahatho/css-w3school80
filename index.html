<!--CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.-->

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
        #para1 {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
    <title>CSS id selector</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
    </p>
    <p>The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!</p>
    <p>To select an element with a specific id, write a hash(#) charachter, followed by the id of the element.</p>
    <p id="para1">Hello World!</p>
    <p>This paragraph is not affected by the style</p>
</body>
</html>
