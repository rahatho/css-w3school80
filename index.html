<!--CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.-->

            text-align: center;
            color: red;
        }

<body>
    <h1>The CSS element selector</h1>
    <p>The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.</p>
    <p>
        Every paragraph will be affected by the style.
