<!--CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.-->

    <h1>CSS Combinators</h1>
    <p>
        A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
    </p>
    <p>There are four different combinators in CSS:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>descendant selector (space)</li>
        <li>child selector (>)</li>
        <li>adjacent sibling selector (+)</li>
        <li>general sibling selector (~)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Descendant Selector</h2>

    <p>The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.</p>

    <p>The following example selects all p elements inside div elements:</p>
    
    <div>
        <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
        <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>
        <section>
            <p>Paragraph 3 in the div.</p>
        </section>
    </div>

    <p>Paragraph 4 not in the div.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 5 not in the div.</p>
  

</body>
